## 💡 Why MLOps Matters

Traditional DevOps practices alone aren't enough for ML systems because:

| Traditional Software | Machine Learning Systems |
|----------------------|--------------------------|
| Code is deterministic | Models are probabilistic |
| Dependencies are code libraries | Dependencies include data |
| Testing is straightforward | Testing requires statistical validation |
| Monitoring focuses on system health | Monitoring includes model performance |
| Versioning is primarily code | Versioning includes code, data, and models |

## 🔮 The Future of MLOps

As ML becomes more integrated into business operations, we can expect:

- 🤖 **AutoML** becoming more sophisticated
- 🔄 **Continuous learning** systems that adapt in real-time
- 🧩 **Composable ML systems** with reusable components
- 🔒 **Enhanced governance** for responsible AI
- 🌐 **Edge ML** becoming more prevalent
