## ðŸ”„ Connecting the Stages

The MLOps lifecycle is not a linear process but a continuous loop:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Problem Definition] -->|Define Requirements| B[Data Engineering]
    B -->|Provide Features| C[Model Development]
    C -->|Deliver Model| D[Model Deployment]
    D -->|Serve Predictions| E[Monitoring & Feedback]
    E -->|Identify Issues| F[Retraining]
    F -->|Update Data| B
    
    E -.->|Refine Problem| A
    
    classDef default fill:#FFFFFF,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px;
    
    class A,B,C,D,E,F default;
```

**Key Integration Points:**

1. **Feedback Loops**: Each stage provides feedback to previous stages
   - Monitoring insights inform retraining needs
   - Deployment challenges improve model development
   - Model performance refines problem definition

2. **Automation**: Automate transitions between stages where possible
   - Automated data pipelines
   - CI/CD for model deployment
   - Automated monitoring and alerting

3. **Versioning**: Track changes across all stages
   - Code versioning
   - Data versioning
   - Model versioning
   - Configuration versioning

4. **Documentation**: Document decisions and artifacts at each stage
   - Decision logs
   - Model cards
   - Data dictionaries
   - Deployment specifications

5. **Governance**: Apply consistent governance across the lifecycle
   - Access controls
   - Approval workflows
   - Audit trails
   - Compliance checks
